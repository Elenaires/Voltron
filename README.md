<p>See the application by visiting https://elenaires.github.io/Voltron.</p>
<p>See https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages on how to deploy a React app to Github pages </p> 
<p>Originally, this app was created to communicates with a server to fetch and post data.</p>
<p>However, I couldn't figure out how to make github pages work with json server (many said github pages only host static site) hence data for this web app is loaded directly from json and images files saved in this branch. Users will not be able to add comments or submit a feedback via the app.</p>
<p>This branch contains the result of the build (npm run deploy) while master contains the original source code</p>
