<p>This is a ReactJS application. See the app by visiting https://elenaires.github.io/Voltron.</p>
<p>Originally, this app was created to communicates with a server to fetch and post data.</p>
<p>However, as github pages only host static site, data for this web app is loaded directly from json and images files saved in this repo (instead of loading from json server). Users will not be able to add comments or submit a feedback via the app.</p>
<p>This branch contains the result of the build (npm run deploy) while master contains the original source code</p>
<p>See https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages on how to deploy a React app to Github pages </p>
